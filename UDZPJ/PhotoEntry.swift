                    self.information = "\tStorks are large, long-legged wading birds belonging to the family Ciconiidae, known for their distinctive appearance and soaring flight. They are found on every continent except Antarctica and are often associated with open habitats, wetlands, and grasslands. Storks are characterized by their long, pointed bills, which they use to catch a variety of prey such as fish, frogs, insects, and small mammals. One of the most well-known species is the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia), recognized for its black-tipped wings and its habit of nesting on rooftops and other structures. \n\tMany stork species are known for their impressive migratory journeys, covering vast distances between breeding and wintering grounds. During migration, storks often travel in large flocks, utilizing thermal updrafts to minimize energy expenditure. Storks are also renowned for their nesting behaviors, with many species building large stick nests in trees or on man-made structures. They are often monogamous, forming strong pair bonds, and both parents participate in incubating the eggs and caring for the chicks. \n\tIn various cultures, storks are symbols of good luck, fertility, and prosperity. The association between storks and babies is a popular cultural motif, and they are often depicted delivering newborns in folklore. Despite their cultural significance, some stork populations face threats such as habitat loss, pollution, and disturbances to their breeding areas. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their nesting sites, preserving wetlands, and raising awareness about the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems for the survival of these elegant and emblematic birds."

                    self.information = "\tWolverines (Gulo gulo) are carnivorous mammals known for their stocky and muscular build, as well as their reputation for strength and ferocity. Native to the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, wolverines inhabit remote and harsh environments such as tundra, taiga, and alpine meadows. These elusive creatures are well-adapted to cold climates, equipped with thick fur that insulates them from extreme temperatures. Wolverines have a distinct appearance with a bushy tail, powerful jaws, and sharp claws, contributing to their effectiveness as formidable predators and scavengers. \n\tWolverines are opportunistic feeders, with a diet that includes a variety of prey such as rodents, birds, and carrion. Despite their relatively small size, wolverines are known for their strength and endurance, allowing them to take down larger prey or scavenge from other predators. They are also renowned for their ability to cover vast distances in search of food, utilizing their wide home ranges. Wolverines are solitary animals, and each individual occupies a large territory, often overlapping with the territories of other wolverines. \n\tThe conservation status of wolverines varies across their range, with some populations facing threats from habitat loss, climate change, and trapping. Their elusive nature and remote habitats make it challenging to study and monitor wolverine populations accurately. Conservation efforts focus on preserving their habitats, understanding their ecological roles, and implementing measures to reduce human-wolverine conflicts. Wolverines hold cultural significance in some indigenous communities, and their presence in the wild contributes to the biodiversity and ecological health of the northern ecosystems they inhabit."
                    
                case "Wyoming Toad":
                    self.information = "\tThe Wyoming Toad (*Anaxyrus baxteri*) is one of the most endangered amphibians in North America, found exclusively in the Laramie Basin of Wyoming. Once widespread in the region, this species experienced a drastic population decline due to habitat loss, pesticide use, disease, and climate change. By the 1980s, the Wyoming Toad was believed to be extinct in the wild, but conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs, have helped reintroduce small populations into protected wetland areas.  \n\tThis toad is a medium-sized amphibian with a warty, brownish-gray body that provides excellent camouflage against its natural surroundings. It primarily inhabits floodplains, wetlands, and grassy meadows near bodies of water, where it feeds on insects and other small invertebrates. Like many toads, it has a nocturnal lifestyle, becoming most active in the evening when temperatures are cooler. During the breeding season, males produce a distinctive call to attract females, and eggs are laid in shallow waters, where tadpoles develop before transforming into juvenile toads. \n\tDespite ongoing conservation efforts, the Wyoming Toad remains critically endangered due to persistent threats such as chytrid fungus, a deadly amphibian disease. Recovery programs, including habitat restoration, disease management, and breeding in captivity for reintroduction, are crucial to its survival. Scientists and conservationists continue to monitor wild and released populations, hoping to increase their numbers and restore this unique species to its native ecosystem. Protecting the Wyoming Toad is not only important for its survival but also for maintaining biodiversity in the wetlands it inhabits."

There are three main species of zebras: the plains zebra (Equus quagga), the Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi), and the mountain zebra (Equus zebra). Each species has its unique characteristics, but all share the striking black and white striping that serves as a form of camouflage, as well as a visual deterrent to predators. \n\tZebras are herbivores, predominantly grazing on grasses, and their social structure is typically organized in family groups led by a dominant male, known as a stallion. These family groups, called harems, are comprised of females and their offspring. Zebras are known for their agility and speed, which they use to escape from predators like lions and hyenas. Interestingly, each zebra's stripe pattern is unique, similar to human fingerprints, allowing for individual recognition within a herd. \n\tDespite their iconic status, zebras face various threats, including habitat loss, competition for resources with livestock, and poaching. Conservation efforts aim to protect their natural habitats, establish wildlife corridors, and address the complex challenges associated with human-wildlife conflicts. Zebras contribute to the biodiversity and balance of African ecosystems, and their conservation is crucial not only for their well-being but for the health of the entire savanna ecosystem they inhabit."
